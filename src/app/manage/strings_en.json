The anticipated payment schedule is always outlined on the investment offering page as well as in the legal agreement. \r\n\r\nAn event-based payment schedule means that investors receive payments as soon as the policies reach maturity and the proceeds are paid. \r\nPayment dates and amounts cannot be pre-determined because the timing of the maturity is uncertain and as such, payments may be earlier or later than anticipated.\r\nPayments are not guaranteed and may be subject to delay or total loss. See the risk factors for each applicable offering for more details."

            "answer": "LiST is paid management fees that are specific to each investment and are outlined in the investment agreement. This fee includes all management aspects, such as third-party vendors and servicing providers.\r\nIn addition, LiST receives a percentage of the policy’s death benefit, which does not exceed 5% of the face value of the policy.\r\nPlease note that all of the IRR calculations, as stated in the relevant offering, are net of LiST’s fees.\r"

            "answer": "Taxation in general, and taxation of life settlements and/or investments in life settlements should be discussed with your lawyer/accountant/tax advisor. \r\nIn general, under US tax law, the death benefit proceeds, less the applicable tax basis, arising from a life insurance policy acquired in the life insurance market are deemed to be ordinary income, subject to ordinary tax rates. The tax basis generally equals the purchase amount incurred to acquire the policy, in addition to premiums paid from the purchase date until the maturity date of the policy. \r\nLiST takes no responsibility with respect to this issue. \r"

This is also calculated based on the actuarial underwriting and/or the relevant mortality tables. The IRR will only be known upon maturity of the policy and once proceeds are distributed. The return very much depends on the longevity of the insured.",

In general, and particularly with respect to longevity linked assets, it is prudent to diversify your investments. As such, it is worthwhile considering investment of a small amount in a single investment, compared to the total amount that you plan to invest in the asset class.",

There are several risks to consider such as, but not limited to, the longevity of the policyholder (i.e., the remaining lifespan of the policyholder will impact upon the return), carrier default risk (i.e., the risk of the carrier defaulting), policy risks (i.e., claims raised by the carrier according to which no/partial payout is due), or increase of the insurance rates, which may, in turn, increase the premium payments) and the lapsing of policy risk. At LiST, we do our best to perform due diligence on every policy, however, some of these risks are unpredictable and can have a dramatic impact on yields. We do not advise you to invest any amount that you cannot afford to lose in full.",

        "qa_whySellingPolicy": "Why is the policyholder selling the policy?",
        "qa_whySellingPolicy_a": "Generally, policies are sold in the secondary market, despite the fact that in many cases, the insured has held the policy for several decades. We have found that one of the main reasons for policy sales is due to the high costs of maintaining the policy premiums, that tend to increase to high and unaffordable rates. This leads certain policyholders to stop making the premiums payments which results in the policy lapsing. Others sell the policy to investors for a small amount of its face value and do not benefit from the proceeds upon maturity. LiST enables the policyholders with an empowering solution where they can stop paying premiums and, in many cases, still benefit from the proceeds upon maturity.",
        "qa_whatHappens": "What happens if I am not interested in continuing my investment?",
        "qa_whatHappens_a": "In general, the investment structure of this offering requires continuous investment from the initial closing date until the policy matures. With that said, we understand that circumstances may change, and that you may not be interested in continuing investments in the future. As such, you have the possibility of stopping your funding and retaining your interest in the investment based on the pro-rata amount already invested. You will be required to find a replacement for your investment that is pre approved by LiST. LiST can also reach out to our network as well in order to assist in finding an alternative investor. However, to the extent that no investor may be found based on the initial offering conditions, it may be necessary to auction off your investment portion, which may impact upon your initial investment.",
